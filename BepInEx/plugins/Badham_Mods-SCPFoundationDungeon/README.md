# SCP Foundation Dungeon

## Features:
Adds the SCP foundation as a dungeon that can spawn (by default on Titan, config can be adjusted to spawn on a variety of different moons including custom ones)
Includes custom assets in the SCP style, and a fully functional SCP 914 if you can find it.

**NOTE:** This mod requires everyone in the lobby to have it installed to avoid desync; everyone must also share the config settings (config sync may be implemented later)
**WARNING:** Currently Lethal Expansion has known compatibility issues, use at your own discretion. [Lethal Expansion Core](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/jockie/LethalExpansionCore/) is reportedly more stable if you want custom moons/scrap designed for LE, but there are no guarantees.

## How to Install:
- Make sure you have [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) & [LethalLib](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalLib/) & [LethalLevelLoader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IAmBatby/LethalLevelLoader/) installed.
- Download and unzip the mod.
- Merge the BepInEx folder from this zip with the one found at: (`\GAME_LOCATION\Lethal Company\BepInEx`)
- NOTE: For manual installs, a subfolder must be made for the SCP 914 recipe folder (e.g. (`\GAME_LOCATION\Lethal Company\BepInEx\SCP914\badhamknibbs-scp914-recipes\..scp 914 json files here..`)
- Optional: Launch and close the game to generate config file.
