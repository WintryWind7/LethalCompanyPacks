### [0.5.0]

Highlights:

**Massive UI Overhaul**
- Cleaned up the base game controls to be more organized.
- Added Controller Glyphs for Xbox and DualSense controllers with automatic detection.
    - *Glyphs only show up in the rebind menu for now, a future update will have them be visible in game.*
    - *Api to request controller glyphs for a control path will be available in a future update.*
- Controls added by mods are seperated by mod.
- Controls manually injected into the vanilla ui by mods are available in "Legacy Controls".

Controls can now be unbound.

*Controller navigation of the new UI is still a ***WIP***, hoping to improve it in a future update.*

### [0.4.4]

Text in the remap ui now has auto-scaling size.
Remap ui no longer cuts-off the bottom of the controller section.
Changed method for determining the BepInPlugin of dependents.

### [0.4.3]

`LcInputActions.Asset` now has a public getter.
Fixed issue where binds that were unbound by default would not save/load their new binds after restarting your game.

### [0.4.2]

Hotfix for applying migrations when the new file already existed, no longer crashes the mod.

### [0.4.1]

Bind overrides have been moved from `BepInEx/controls` to `BepInEx/config/controls` allowing for bind overrides to be distributed with modpacks.

### [0.4.0]

InputActions can now be made at runtime by overriding the method `CreateInputActions(...)` and using the provided builder.

### [0.3.0]

The only required parameter for the InputActions attribute is now only just the kbmPath, the rest are now optional.
Should help improve DX.

### [0.2.0]

Interactions for the kbm and gamepad bindings can now be set in the attribute.

### [0.1.0]

Initial Beta Release.
