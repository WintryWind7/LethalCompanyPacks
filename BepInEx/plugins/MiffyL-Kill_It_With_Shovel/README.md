# Kill-It-With-Shovel

# Introduction

Have you ever meet a turret face-to-face at the entrance?

If you have--and like me, you're super annoyed by it, this mod is for you! 

# Description
You can now:
- Disable the turret for 5 seconds by hitting it with a shovel.
- Enable the turret again by hitting it twice.  **BEWARE: turret does NOT like being disturbed in sleep.**

# Config Options

## Berseker Mode when being waked

**Enabled:** The turret will fire and swing like vanilia when you hit it while it is disabled.


**Disabled:** The turret will stay disabled, but the duration will not stack the more times you hit.


## Disable Duration

The time it takes for turret to become active again, in seconds.
