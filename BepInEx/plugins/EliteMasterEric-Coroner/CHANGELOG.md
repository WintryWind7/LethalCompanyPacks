# Changelog

# Upcoming
[] Implement Stun Grenade death

# 1.5.2
## Fixed
- Attempting to fix an issue caused when installing Coroner without R2Modman.

# 1.5.1
## Added
- Added a new French localization.
## Changed
- I have removed LC_API as a dependency from the manifest. Coroner on its own does a reasonable job of synchronizing cause of death messages across clients without it, in my experience, to a greater extent than I originally thought. I do not anticipate making it a dependency again in the future. Apologies for the inconvenience.
- Improved the Dutch localization.

# 1.5.0
## Added
- Added a new localization feature! Coroner now has official support for English, Dutch, and Russian.
    - If you want to help localize Coroner for other languages, please visit the Lethal Company Modding Discord or submit a pull request on GitHub, I would GREATLY appreciate your contributions.
## Changed
- LC_API has been readded as a dependency after the 3.0.0 update fixed all the weird bu.
## Fixed
