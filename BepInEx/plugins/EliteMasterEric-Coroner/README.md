# Coroner

A plugin which overhauls the end-of-mission Performance Report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players. There are some fun easter eggs thrown in too.

Supports v45.

Now in v1.5.0, language support! Open the mod config to set your language.

**NOTE:** It is recommended to use [Russian textures](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hayrizan/Russian_textures/) if you use the Russian language texture..

**NOTE:** [LC_API](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/2018/LC_API/) is an optional but recommended dependency. Certain causes of death will fail to syncronize between clients in some circumstances but LC_API fixes this issue.
