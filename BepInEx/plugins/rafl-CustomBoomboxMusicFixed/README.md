# Custom Boombox Music (Fixed)
Allows players to add to or replace boombox tracks in Lethal Company.  
Based on [Custom Boombox Music](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Steven/Custom_Boombox_Music/) by [Steven](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Steven/).  
Fixed to properly sync in multiplayer.

## Installing Songs when Installed via r2modman

When mods are installed with r2modman, BepInEx gets configured to place mod files in a different location

You can find the correct folder by going to `Settings`, clicking `Browse profile folder`, then navigating to `BepInEx\Custom Songs\Boombox Music`.
