# ReservedWeaponSlot
<strong>Requires: <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedItemSlotCore/">ReservedItemSlotCore</a></strong><br>
This mod gives you a free, dedicated item slot for weapons!<br>
These item slots are aligned on the right side of the screen, and stack vertically with my other ReservedItemSlot mods, such as the ReservedFlashlightSlot, ReservedWalkieSlot and ReservedSprayPaintSlot mods. Check them out!

You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them.<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.

This slot accepts shovels, signs, shotguns, zap-guns, stun grenade, and the diy-flashbang. If I do end up making a reserved utility slot mod, the stun grenade and flashbang will likely be moved to that mod.<br>
This mod also accepts weapons from other popular mods, such as a few from LethalThings: Rocket launcher, toy gun, toy hammer and the flaregun.

<strong>This mod does NOT include the most deadly weapon, the ladder</strong>. I apologize for the inconvenience.

## Now includes a Reserved ammo slot!
This slot will appear on the left side of the screen, and currently accepts shotgun shells, and LethalThings' emergency flaregun ammo.<br>
This slot can be disabled in the config, and if you're the host, this setting will sync to all non-host clients.

### Future plans

+ Adding holstered points on players for each weapon. When holstered, the weapon in the reserved weapon slot will appear on other players, including yourself when viewing yourself in third person with popular third person mods.
+ Add reserved hotkey for quick swapping to weapon slot, as requested by a few people.
