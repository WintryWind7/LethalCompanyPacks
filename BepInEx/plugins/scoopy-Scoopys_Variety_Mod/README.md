# Scoopy's Variety Mod 

## Overview

Currently, the mod adds two new interiors, and some new scrap items. These interior is comprised of custom assets and is intended to add some variety to the interiors in the base game. 

The dungeon interior is a sprawling and dark crypt style interior with a high degree of verticality compared to the base interiors. 

The sewer interior is cluttered with garbage and flooded with ankle-deep water, with a closer style to the vanilla interiors. It is still in an early stage, and may still have some issues, and will have more content added in future.

If you encounter any bugs you'd like to report, please post them in the LethalExtension thread located in the "mod-releases" section of the Lethal Company modding discord (https://discord.com/servers/lethal-company-modding-1168655651455639582).
