<h1>Dynamic Scraps Amount</h1>
The mod will spawn additional scraps in the dungeon when required quota has surpassed 1000.<br>
At that point, an additional scrap will spawn in the dungeon for every 100 required quota.<br>
For example, a required quota of 1500 will make it so that 5 more scraps spawn in the dungeon each day.<br>
<br>
Requires BepInEx. If downloaded manually, go to Lethal Company's local files and place the "DynamicScrapsAmount.dll" inside the "Lethal Company/BepInEx/plugins" directory
