# ReservedSprayPaintSlot
<strong>Requires: <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedItemSlotCore/">ReservedItemSlotCore</a></strong><br>
This mod gives you a free, dedicated item slot for spraypaint cans!.<br>
These item slots are aligned on the right side of the screen, and stack vertically with my other ReservedItemSlot mods, such as the ReservedFlashlightSlot and ReservedWalkieSlot mods. Check them out!<br>
<br>
You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them.<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.<br>
<br>
The spraypaint sits nicely on your waist when not in your hand.
<br>
This mod also adds (optional) quality of life tweaks to the spraypaint, such as extended capacity, longer spray time, longer spray distance, etc.<br>
Currently, only the extended capcity is implemented, and set to 10x, but editable in the config. This setting does not sync yet, but this will be implemented soon!
