# CleanerLogs

Allows you to set the log level used by the base game logs. Logging is pretty intensive (since it writes to a file) and most players don't need the Info log messages the game spits out constantly (especially if there's a Nutcracker around!) so this can be a significant performance boost for weaker machines.

This does not affect the logging output by other mods, but even still this technically can affect other mod authors' ability to diagnose issues with their mods, so use with caution.
