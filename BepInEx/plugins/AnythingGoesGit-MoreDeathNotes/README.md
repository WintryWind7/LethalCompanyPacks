# MoreDeathNotes

A plugin designed to enhance the end-of-mission Performance Report by adding new details, such as the cause of death for any players who didn't survive. It also includes some entertaining easter eggs for added fun

**NOTE:** [LC_API](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/2018/LC_API/) is an optional but highly recommended dependency!
