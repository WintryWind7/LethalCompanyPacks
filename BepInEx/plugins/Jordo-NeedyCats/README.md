# Needy Cats v1.1.1
### <i>You like cats? The company likes cats too! Find them roaming the various abandoned facilities and bring them home*!</i>

Ever wanted to bring felines into Lethal Company? It is now possible with this mod! You will see cats that roam around, meow <b>(loudly, be careful!)</b> and sit down when they feel safe. <br> Make sure to pet them regularly, otherwise they may attract unwanted guests with their noise.

The host can modify the spawn rate of cats (default to 20) and [modify the pool of available cat names as well as assign specific fur colors per name if desired.](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Jordo/NeedyCats/wiki/1048-modifying-the-cats-names/)

<sub>*The company pledges not to harm the cats.</sub>

## Known issues
- Picking up and dropping a cat during the takeoff or landing phase may leave them stuck in place and possibly lost forever.
- Some screen effects make the cats see through.
