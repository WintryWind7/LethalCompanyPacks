## v1.1.1
- Fixed incomplete & confusing description of the names config option

## v1.1.0
- Cat names have been moved to the mod's config, albeit less readable, it allows for easier sharing with profile codes
	- Names are delimited by a comma (,)
	- Furs can also be assigned using colon (:)
	- [Read more about the cat names changes including a list of the possible fur colors here](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Jordo/NeedyCats/wiki/1048-modifying-the-cats-names/) 
- Cats have been tweaked to be a bit less needy:
	- By default
	- After being pet
	- In the ship *next to an employee*
	- If certain decorations are present on the ship
- Cats will now be much more quiet in walkie-talkies
- Cats will now meow slightly more quietly (for the dogs) if they are in the ship
- Fixed a bug where cats would not sit in the ship for some players
- Fixed a bug where cats would not appear on custom moons created using LethalExpansion (thanks broiiler for reporting the issue)
