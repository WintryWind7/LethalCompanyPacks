# The Scarlet Devil Mansion（紅魔館）

Adds the Scarlet Devil Mansion from Touhou as a possible dungeon for the snow moons (Dine, Rend, Tital). The chances are about 50% split between the regular mansion dungeon and this custom dungeon. You can edit the weight value in the config. If you'd like a cheap way to get there, we do happen to have a [mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Alice/MoonRoutePriceMod/) for just that.

The dungeon can also be enabled on any moon, vanilla or custom, in the config. I'm not responsible if the dungeon breaks on custom moons.

This is an alpha release. We are currently polishing up the rooms and adding unique dungeon mechanics, enemies, and items. We cannot guarantee stablity with other mods.

## Dungeon Layout

The map is a grayscale representation of what the Scarlet Devil Mansion could look like, with a mayor starting room, hallway corriders, and typical mansion rooms (bedrooms, libraries, kitchens, etc.). The fire exit always leads to a garden.

This dungeon uses modified dungeon generation code to create three long paths (as opposed to the base game's single path), then creates branching paths like normal. Furthermore, the dungeon will always be confined to a relatively small box. Please understand that this will increase dungeon generation times (sometimes by double or even triple). While it seems that the dungeon generation has no bugs currently, there is a possibility that it can still occur.

## Enemies and Vents

Enemies will not spawn from vents but from summoning sigils on the ground. This is only a visual change.

  <b>The Knight</b>, a Coil-head variant
  <br>
  Acts like a regular coil-head, but is noticeably slower and prefers spawning from statue props, especially ones passed by scavengers.

## Dungeon Events

The dungeon features events similiar to the base game's appartatus. For the lack of a better word, I will be calling them Dungeon Events.
Engaging in these events can increase the amount of loot you and your scavengers buddies can bring back, if you can survive that is.

  A high value scrap item. However, the residents don't take too kindly to thieves.

## Configuration

You can configure the following properties of this dungeon in the config. You must load up Lethal Company once with this mod enabled to create the config. All configs are synced by the host.

* The weight of the SDM dungeon appearing on the snow maps
* SDM dungeon appearing on any vanilla or custom moon, along with its weights
* Most of the dungeon generation values and scrap count
* The weights of light and light sources appearing in the dungeon

## Roadmap for v1.2

v1.2 introduces the first dungeon event. The goal for the v1.2 series is to guarantee that this event has no issues while improving upon it.
The secondary goals are to continue polishing the rest of the room tiles and to add breakable map objects. 

## Roadmap in General

The development process is generally split into 3 distinct parts:

* Create more rooms, room variants, and polish up the current ones with props, lighting, etc.
* Add touhou-themed enemies and scrap items
* Add dungeon mechanics/features (for example the factory's appartatus and jumping puzzles)

There is a possibility that I add a custom moon, but that's way down the line.
